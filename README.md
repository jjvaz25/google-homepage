From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

In this project I am going to try to build the Google Homepage. I have not attempted to replicate another website. This will be my first attempt, and really my first application of the skills I've aquired in HTML and CSS

This is me making an edit to practice my commits before starting.
